# Introduction
## üìä SQL Project: Data Analyst Job Market Analysis (2023)

This project explores a dataset provided by Luke Barousse, containing job postings from 2023. Using SQL, I analyzed the dataset to uncover insights specific to Data Analyst roles ‚Äî including salary trends, top-paying positions, and the most in-demand and high-value skills.

The key objectives of this project were to:

- Identify the top-paying Data Analyst jobs across various companies.
- Determine the most required skills for data analyst roles in 2023.
- Analyze which skills offer the highest average salary, revealing where technical expertise drives pay growth.

This project demonstrates practical SQL applications in data exploration, aggregation, and insight generation, providing a clear snapshot of how skillsets and technologies shape pay and demand in the data analytics job market.

# Background

The demand for data professionals has grown rapidly in recent years, and 2023 continued to highlight the vital role of data analysts in modern organizations. As businesses increasingly depend on data-driven insights, knowing which skills are most sought after ‚Äî and which lead to higher salaries ‚Äî has become more important than ever.

This project is based on a dataset shared by Luke Barousse, containing job postings from 2023. The analysis focuses on Data Analyst positions, exploring the top-paying roles, the most in-demand skills, and the skills that command the highest pay.

The goal of this project is to gain a clearer understanding of the evolving data analyst job market and identify the technical skills that drive both demand and earning potential.
### Through this project, I‚Äôm using SQL queries to find answers to the following questions:
1. Question- What are the top paying Data Analyst jobs?
2.  Question- What skills are required for top paying Data Analyst jobs?
3. Question: What are the most in demand skills for data analyst?
4. Questions - What are the top paying Skills?
5. Question- What are the Optimal Skill to have or aquire i.e( High demand and High paying)?


# Tools Used

### To carry out this analysis effectively, I used a combination of tools that supported data handling, query execution, and project management.

- **SQL** ‚Äì Used to clean, filter, and analyze the dataset efficiently. It helped uncover insights such as top-paying data analyst roles, high-demand skills, and salary trends based on different criteria.

- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Served as the primary database management system, allowing structured storage and execution of complex SQL queries for deeper data exploration.

- **Visual Studio Code** ‚Äì Used as the main coding environment for writing, testing, and organizing SQL scripts. Its extensions for database connections made workflow smooth and productive.

- **Git & GitHub** ‚Äì Utilized for version control, project documentation, and showcasing the project publicly. Helped maintain transparency and track changes throughout development.

**Disclaimer:**
This project is for educational and portfolio purposes only. The dataset belongs to Luke Barousse.
